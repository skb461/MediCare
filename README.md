## Setup Instructions

1. **Database Setup**:
   - Create a MySQL database named `medicare`.
   - Run the following SQL to create the required tables:

     ```sql
     CREATE TABLE HomeDelivery (
         id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
         hname VARCHAR(255),
         nid VARCHAR(255),
         phone VARCHAR(255),
         email VARCHAR(255),
         haddress TEXT
     );

     CREATE TABLE OrderMedicines (
         id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
         order_id INT,
         medicine_name VARCHAR(255),
         amount INT,
         FOREIGN KEY (order_id) REFERENCES HomeDelivery(id)
     );

     CREATE TABLE Medicines (
         id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
         name VARCHAR(255),
         price DECIMAL(10, 2),
         available_quantity INT
     );

     CREATE TABLE Dispensaries (
         id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
         name VARCHAR(255),
         address VARCHAR(255)
     );
     ```

2. **Configure Database Connection**:
   - Update `db_connection.php` with your database credentials:

     ```php
     <?php
     $servername = "your_server";
     $username = "your_username";
     $password = "your_password";
     $dbname = "medicare";

     // Create connection
     $conn = new mysqli($servername, $username, $password, $dbname);

     // Check connection
     if ($conn->connect_error) {
         die("Connection failed: " . $conn->connect_error);
     }
     ?>
     ```

3. **Admin Login Configuration**:
   - In `login.php`, update the hardcoded credentials if desired. By default:
     - **Username**: `admin`
     - **Password**: `password123`

4. **File Uploads and Permissions**:
   - Ensure that the `uploads` directory exists and is writable if you plan to enable file uploads (e.g., for prescriptions).

5. **Run the Project**:
   - Place the project files in your PHP serverâ€™s root directory.
   - Access `index.php` via `http://localhost/index.php` for the main site or `http://localhost/login.php` for the admin login.

## Usage

1. **User Workflow**:
   - Users can visit the home page to navigate to services like Home Delivery and view the Medicines and Dispensary lists.
   - For delivery requests, users can fill out the form on `home_delivery.php`.

2. **Admin Workflow**:
   - Log in via `login.php` to access the admin dashboard.
   - Manage delivery orders and view customer details under "Delivery Orders."
   - Add or update inventory items under "Medicines Inventory."

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS (custom styling in `style.css`), Bootstrap 5 for responsive design.
- **Backend**: PHP for server-side processing.
- **Database**: MySQL for data storage.
